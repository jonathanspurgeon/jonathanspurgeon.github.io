        <h2>Could music be another parable from God?</h2>

          Creation reveals the glory of God. You’ve probably seen this verse paired with breathtaking images of mountains, stars, forests, or oceans reminding us of the majesty woven into the natural world. But God’s creativity isn’t limited to what we can see. It includes the unseen and the intangible. Music, art, language, mathematics to name a few. These, too, are His handiwork. And interestingly, they often draw inspiration from the observables themselves. As a musician, I sometimes wonder, as far-fetched it might seem, if music in its very essence, not just through worship songs but through its very structure, could reveal something of God's glory? Could the theory of music somehow point us to Jesus? This contemplation provoked the inspiration behind this article.

The Bible is deliciously stuffed with accounts of a person or people turning away from the presence of our loving Father, and of God invariably rescuing and forgiving them by His unworldly kindness and mercy which is something all Christians can surely relate to. 
Some prominent examples include the Israelites complaining and rebelling an unbelievable number of times, yet God continues to lead them toward the Promised Land; Jonah fleeing from God’s call to go to Nineveh, yet God putting him back where He wanted him, which leads to Nineveh's repentance; and Peter denying Jesus three times out of fear, yet Jesus inviting him back with “Feed my sheep,” and boy, did he nourish them. However, the most exciting example is the fall of man through eating the forbidden fruit and hiding from God, and yet God still promises redemption (Genesis 3:15) and eventually fulfills it through Jesus.

There’s an impressive similarity between these stories and the structure of a standard musical work. You begin at the home/root chord or at least somewhere nearby within its chord family. Then, with our free will, we wander, exploring what lies beyond the familiar, venturing into supposedly rejuvenating, uncharted territories. There are major movements and minor ones, highs and lows. We add dissonance to spice things up, and the rising tension is exhilarating. We keep building and building, delighting in the tension we’ve created, but eventually, something feels off. There’s a pull toward something deeply inviting- a saving chord that whispers that true tranquility is found here, and nowhere else. In that moment, you realize that the chord that began everything is also where ultimate resolution is found. The author is also the finisher.

How profoundly indistinguishable is the aforementioned narrative to the parable of the prodigal son. 
Matthew 13:34 hints at God's inclination towards talking in parables. 
Could music be another parable from God? Maybe it's a fanciful idea but if it is, it’s heart-stirring to consider that every time we hear music, we are listening to an allegory of God’s redemption plan and I think that's utterly beautiful. May we glorify God with our music.
